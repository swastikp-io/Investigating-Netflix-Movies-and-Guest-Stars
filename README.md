# Investigating-Netflix-Movies-and-Guest-Stars

## Overview
This notebook presents a comprehensive exploration of Netflix’s movie dataset with a focus on two central questions:
- How have the durations of movies on Netflix changed over time?
- Who are the most frequent guest stars appearing in Netflix movies?

The workflow demonstrates structured data loading, manipulation, visualization, and extraction of actionable insights from raw streaming data. 

## Contents
Introduction & Dataset Overview: Briefs on the Netflix dataset (titles, type, year, cast, duration, etc.).

- Data Preparation: Filters out non-movie entries to focus the study.

- Movie Duration Analysis: Visualizes how film length has evolved (2011–2020) via line and scatter plots.

- Key Insights: Highlights trends toward shorter-form content in recent releases.

- Guest Star Frequency: Identifies prolific actors, with Anupam Kher emerging as the most featured guest star.

- Summary of Learnings: Summarizes data-driven trends on content and casting.

## Visualizations
- Line Plot: Duration trend by release year.

- Scatter Plot: Movie length distribution across years, with color gradients and theming.

- Tabular Data: Preview tables for both all content and filtered movies.

## Main Learnings
- There is a recent trend toward shorter movies on Netflix, with many new releases running under 100 minutes. This trend suggests evolving viewing habits and platform strategies.

- Anupam Kher is identified as the most prolific actor across thousands of Netflix movies.

The project demonstrates transformation from raw data to meaningful business insights using pandas and matplotlib.
